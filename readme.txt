This is a very cool pop up for WordPress, you can choose after how many seconds it shall appear. The pop up is fully seo optimized which means it follows Googles overlay guidelines. We try our best to keep this plugin updated and we will continue developing it with new features. So stay tuned. We have used code from WP Modal Popup with Cookie Integration by WP OnlineSupport and SPTechnolab to create some of the features in this plugin, such as the cookie integration so it stays hidden for a chosen amount of time after you close it. Please check out their plug-ins and themes, they create really cool WordPress things.
